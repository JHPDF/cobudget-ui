  <div class="resources-page__content" layout="column" flex>
    <p>Cobudget was developed by members of <a href="https://enspiral.com/" target="_blank">Enspiral</a> to support the internal collaborative funding process of the network.</p>

    <p>What was a spreadsheet soon became an app and, led by Derek Razo with support from the Namaste Foundation the app became used more broadly by organizations where members fund projects collaboratively.</p>

    <p>In 2017 a new team from within the network is working to take Cobudget to its next stage, as part of a venture that is supporting the development of a collaborative finance ecosystem.</p>
